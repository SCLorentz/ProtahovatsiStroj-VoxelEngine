# PtotahovatsiStroj
A voxel engine built using **raylib-go** and **OpenGL**

##  Features 🌟
- **Infinite Random World Generation**: Utilizes a Perlin noise algorithm for creating expansive landscapes.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Implemented basic lighting to enhance the visual experience.

## Upcoming Features 📋
- **Layered Landscapes**: Add more geological layers, such as stone.
- **Enhanced Lighting**: Introduce ambient occlusion for better depth perception.
- **Fog Effects**: Create atmospheric depth with fog.
- **Water Formations**: Integrate realistic water bodies into the world generation.
- **Surface Feature System**: Add trees, flowers, and grass to enrich the environment.
- **Block Interaction**: Enable players to place and destroy blocks.
- **Biome Diversity**: Implement various biomes for a richer exploration experience.
